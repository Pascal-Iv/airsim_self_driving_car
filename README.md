# airsim_self_driving_car
Building a convolutional neural network for autonomous driving in a simple virtual environment. 
The virtual environment is Airsim, an open-source simulation environment for cars and drones.
I created training data by manually driving in Airsim, while recording images taken by the front camera and the current steering angle.
